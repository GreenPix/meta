## How to contribute

**Warning:** As for now, **Renaissance** development is not mature
enough to be contributor-friendly. If you want to contribute, you need
to contact the core team directly. The easiest way to do that is by
joining the
[Gitter GreenPix/dev room](https://gitter.im/GreenPix/dev).
