# Roles

## GreenPix

Renaissance is a project leaded by GreenPix, an association under
French Law (Law 1901). GreenPix members are devoted to create a
pleasant game, without either cash shop or advertisment.

### Project Leader

The GreenPix President is the Renaissance Project Leader. The final call
is his.

The current Project Leader is @Azamung.

### Core Team

GreenPix members that are involved in Renaissance software development
form the Core Team.  The Core Team leads the Renaissance
development. With respect with the workflow (see WORKFLOW.md), they
merge regulard and non regular contributors work into `master` branch.

The current Core Team members are:

* @Nemikolh
* @Vaelden
* @Ikyushii

#### Community Mediator

The Community Mediator is a member of the Core Team. His work is to
ease the Renaissance development. For instance, he writes the monthly
recap published in the project forum. He is a good interlocutor if you
want to contribute to Renaissance
([visiting our Gitter room is also a good idea](https://gitter.im/GreenPix/dev).

The current Community Mediator is @Ikyushii.

### Game Design Team

GreenPix members that are involved in Renaissance game design
definition form the Game Design Team. A game design feature
cannot be merged into `master` without their agreement.

## Regular Contributors

Regular contributors are well known and trusted Renaissance
contributors. They can do everything a Core Team member does, except
merge PR into `master`.

## New Contributors

It can be you! New contributors are welcome to help. Because new
contributors cannot push commits directly into GreenPix repositories,
they have to fork them and then do Pull Requests.
